    """Runs your Tensorflow code in Google Cloud Platform.

    Args:
        entry_point: Optional string. File path to the python file or iPython
            notebook that contains the TensorFlow code.
            Note: This path must be in the current working directory tree.
            Example: 'train.py', 'training/mnist.py', 'mnist.ipynb'
            If `entry_point` is not provided, then
            - If you are in an iPython notebook environment, then the
                current notebook is taken as the `entry_point`.
            - Otherwise, the current python script is taken as the
                `entry_point`.
        requirements_txt: Optional string. File path to requirements.txt file
            containing aditional pip dependencies if any. ie. a file with a
            list of pip dependency package names.
            Note: This path must be in the current working directory tree.
            Example: 'requirements.txt', 'deps/reqs.txt'
        distribution_strategy: 'auto' or None. Defaults to 'auto'.
            'auto' means we will take care of creating a Tensorflow
            distribution strategy instance based on the machine configurations
            you have provided using the `chief_config`, `worker_config` and
            `worker_count` params.
            - If the number of workers > 0, we will use
                `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.
            - If number of GPUs > 0, we will use
                `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`
            - Otherwise, we will use `tf.distribute.OneDeviceStrategy`
            If you have created a distribution strategy instance in your script
            already, please set `distribution_stratgey` as None here.
            For example, if you are using `tf.keras` custom training loops,
            you will need to create a strategy in the script for distributing
            the dataset.
        docker_base_image: Optional base docker image to use. Defaults to None.
            Example: 'gcr.io/my_gcp_project/deep_learning:v2'
            If a base docker image is not provided here, we will use a
            Tensorflow docker image (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker)
            as the base image. The version of TensorFlow and Python in that
            case will match your local environment.
            If both docker_base_image and a local TF installation are not
            available, the latest TF docker image will be used.
            For example: 'tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu'
        chief_config: Optional `MachineConfig` that represents the
            configuration for the chief worker in a distribution cluster.
            Defaults to 'auto'. 'auto' maps to a standard gpu config such as
            `COMMON_MACHINE_CONFIGS.P100_1X` (8 cpu cores, 30GB memory,
            1 Nvidia Tesla P100).
        worker_config: Optional `MachineConfig` that represents the
            configuration for the general workers in a distribution cluster.
            Defaults to 'auto'. 'auto' maps to a standard gpu config such as
            `COMMON_MACHINE_CONFIGS.P100_1X` (8 cpu cores, 30GB memory,
            1 Nvidia Tesla P100).
        worker_count: Optional integer that represents the number of general
            workers in a distribution cluster. Defaults to 0. This count does
            not include the chief worker.
        entry_point_args: Optional list of strings. Defaults to None.
            Command line arguments to pass to the `entry_point` program.
        stream_logs: Boolean flag which when enabled streams logs back from
            the cloud job.
        docker_image_bucket_name: Optional string that specifies the docker
            image cloud storage bucket name. If this parameter is set, then we
            will be using Google Cloud Storage and Google Cloud Build for
            docker containerization (https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/).
            If this parameter is not set, then we will use local docker daemon
            process for containerization.
            Cloud build request is queued and we make a maximum of 10 requests
            with a delay of 30 secs in between these requests to inspect the
            status of the build.
            Note: When you are using this API from within an iPython notebook,
            we will default to using Google Cloud Build,
            so `docker_image_bucket_name` must be specified for this use case.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.
